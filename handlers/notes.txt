# Handlers - just like a normal task expect only executed if triggered by another Ansible task

## Good for service restarts (when config files are changed by another Ansible tasks) and other 
##  tasks that you don't want to occur every time an Ansible playbook is run

## The task calling the handler must use the "notify:" directive and a list of handlers to be called
## Example:
## notify:
## - name-of-handler1-to-call
## - name-of-handler2-to-call

## the "name-of-handler1-to-call" above must *exactly* match the value in the "name:" of the handler
